Hey!

My name is Orhun ParmaksÄ±z. I'm living in [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey), working as a **Backend Developer** and studying **Software Engineering**.

I'm an [open source developer](https://github.com/orhun). I've {created,contributed to} a number of open source projects. I mostly work with **Rust**, **Go**, **C**, **Python**, and sometimes **Java**.

I'm very enthusiastic about Linux and I [maintain packages](https://archlinux.org/packages/?maintainer=orhun) for [Arch Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux) as a **Trusted User**.

Read my [manpage](https://orhun.dev/) to learn more about me.

Cheers!
